            <h1 class="homeheading"> BMW M4 </h1>
            <p1 class="intro"> 
                The F82-generation BMW M4 has been on sale since 2014. There have been a few minor changes since its release, but no major overhauls to speak of. Basically, it's a two-door version of the BMW M3 given the M4 designation to fit BMW's  
                current coupe naming scheme. It's powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six making 444 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. Power is fed to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed DCT. Our tester is loaded up with   
                a number of options. The $4,750 M Competition Package adds adaptive suspension, 19-inch wheels and black trim on the exterior. Other options include carbon-ceramic brakes, a heads-up display and the dual-clutch transmission. <br><br> Editor-in-Chief 
                would never buy a car this color, Austin Yellow. Otherwise, I was charmed in many ways by the BMW M4, even if it has some shortcomings. I drove a similarly equipped Audi RS5 the night before and preferred the styling inside and out to the BMW. I 
                also think the Audi's driving experience is a bit better. The M4 felt a touch rougher. At low speeds it was a little uncomfortable with disconcerting gear hunting. To get to the point, I'd rate the RS5 a bit ahead of the M4. A-minus for the Audi, 
                B-plus for the Bimmer. I bet they're comparable on a track. That being said, I'd look long and hard at the M4 if I were in the market for this kind of sports car. BMW's coupes have a dynamic and a presence that is singular and engaging. The steering,
                which I usually tuned to Sport or Sport Plus, is solid. It's the sharpest of this car's quick reflexes. The M carbon ceramic brakes are tight — be careful — jab them too quickly and you'll be pulled forward in the seat. On the back straight of the M1
                Concourse in Michigan, the esses of New York's Monticello or another track that requires strong braking, I bet they'd save my butt. The 3.0-liter TwinPower six feels potent, sounds grumbly and has plenty of firepower. I was less enamored with the
                double-clutch gearbox, but hey, that's the way the world works these days. The voluptuous styling is well-proportioned and makes a statement. I like the RS5 and Mercedes-AMG C63 a bit more for their aggressive use of angles and chrome. Objectively,
                those are more interesting designs. Personally, I like the M4.

                The M4 is the new name for the high-performance version of the coupe it's derived from. The M4 shares it's mechanicals with the new M3 sedan, and together form the performance pinnacle in the 3/4-series line-up. 
                The M4 is available as a coupe or convertible and is powered by a twin turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six cylinder engine that produces 425 horsepower (444 if you add the Competition Package) and 406 lb-ft of torque. 
                Equipped with the same 3-litre twin turbocharged straight-six from its initial launch, the M4’s speed has never been in doubt, but hasBMW been able to reintegrate the finesse which helped define its illustrious forbears?
                There is no quick way to describe how the M4 drive suffice to say it could never be described as dull or benign.The M4's complicated reception has not only been affected by its reputation
                either, because where previous M3s largely had their corner of the market to themselves, the M4 most certainly doesn’t, with the charismatic
                Mercedes-AMG C 63, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV and Audi RS5 all raising their game for class honours.So does the M4 still deserve its place at the
                top of its mount, or has the king been dethroned? Read on to find out.
