                After all, these cars are not cheap. When you want to experience superior quality, you have to pay for superior quality. 
                That means that there are plenty of individuals who would like to know more about this dynamic, good-looking car, whether it’s
                because they are seriously considering purchasing one of their own or they just want to know more because they are fascinated
                with the brand. If you’re interested in knowing more about the car, stick around to learn more about how it has evolved over time.<br>
                With its powerful, motorsport-inspired looks and high-performance technology, the BMW M4 GTS has its sights set squarely on the race 
                track. Thanks to an innovative water injection system helping boost power to 493 hp and track ready chassis, this Special Edition M 
                vehicle recorded a lap time of 7 minutes 28 seconds around the legendary Nürburgring-Nordschleife, the world’s most challenging race
                circuit, making a clear statement about this model’s exceptional dynamic abilities. BMW M GmbH will produce approximately 700 units 
                of the BMW M4 GTS worldwide. In 2016, BMW M GmbH presented the next in its line of sports car special editions in the form of the
                BMW M4 GTS.<br> 
                The new car takes the concept of BMW M3/BMW M4 models radically accentuating their sporting genes another step into
                the future in innovative style. For around 700 enthusiasts worldwide, roughly 300 bound for the first time to US shores, with a
                taste for extra-high output, sharp handling and unbeatable performance, this will be the most agile, radical and powerful M4 ever.
                The BMW M4 GTS sees BMW M GmbH not only celebrating 30 years of the BMW M3/M4 success story but also presenting a perfect model to
                mark the centenary of the BMW brand.

                What should you know about the BMW M4? For starters, know that this is a car that is elite. It looks like a luxury car
                but it performs more like a high-end sports car. As a matter of fact, the M4 is BMWs sportier, more high performing cousin 
                to the BMW 4 series that has been popular with discerning drivers for quite some time. However, that doesn’t mean that everyone 
                who wants their shot at owning and driving an M4 from BMW has actually had that chance.
